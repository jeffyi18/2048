This is a recreation of the classic keyboard game '2048', where the player must combine tiles that 
contain powers of 2 into their sums, but only the tiles that have the same numbers. Continue
combining until you reach tile 2048! Board directions include up, down, right, and left

To run the game, download the repository files and use the command "npx browser-sync -sw" in terminal from within the directory to play the game
